//! In-process DBus broker — IO loop + listener + per-connection state
//! that owns the unix sockets and drives the byte-stream state machine
//! provided by [`crate::broker`] and the fcitx5 classifier provided by
//! [`crate::fcitx`].
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Bind a Unix socket inside `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/emthin-dbus-<pid>/bus.sock`
//!   that embedded apps dial via `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`.
//! - For each accepted client, dial the real upstream session bus.
//! - Drive both halves of the pair via non-blocking `recvmsg` /
//!   `sendmsg` (so `SCM_RIGHTS` ancillary fds round-trip — see
//!   [`cmsg`]).
//! - On the `client → bus` direction, intercept the fcitx5 frontend
//!   methods via [`crate::fcitx`] classifier + reply synthesizer and
//!   forward everything else verbatim.
//! - On the `bus → client` direction, parse messages so we can attach
//!   declared `unix_fds` to outbound packets, observe `GetNameOwner`
//!   replies / `NameOwnerChanged` signals, and refresh the cached
//!   fcitx5 unique name used as `sender` on synthesized signals.
//!
//! # Design choices
//!
//! - The broker struct owns fds and protocol state; the calloop glue
//!   lives in the consumer crate's `main.rs` (e.g. `emthin`'s
//!   `register_dbus_sources`) so this module has zero calloop dep.
//!   This keeps it unit-testable with plain `socketpair()`.
//! - Writes use a `VecDeque<OutPacket>` back-pressure queue per
//!   direction, mirroring the pattern in `emthin::ipc`'s server. Each
//!   packet equals one DBus message (post-SASL) so its `unix_fds` ride
//!   together with the first byte of the message header.
